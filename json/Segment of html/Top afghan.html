    <h1 class="a-headline">What does Afghan warlord Hekmatyar's return mean?</h1>
    <p> The leader of Afghanistan's second-largest militant group, Mr Hekmatyar is an Islamist warlord accused of numerous atrocities during the civil war of the 1990s.</p>
    <p>But he has signed a peace deal with the Western-backed Afghan government and says he is abandoning violence.</p>
    <p>IAfghan leaders say the deal is a step forward for the nation, but how significant is it really and what are Mr Hekmatyar's plans now?</p>
    <p>Will this help the security situation?</p>

    <p>But is there a bigger picture?</p>
    <p>Yes. His return is of greater symbolic importance. Mr Hekmatyar is still regarded as a religious figure who led a significant resistance movement against the former Soviet Union occupation of Afghanistan under the banner of jihad.</p>>
    <h1>Hekmatyar's history:</h1>
    <ul class="news-ul">
        <li><a href="javascript:;">One of seven anti-Soviet faction chiefs who led mujahideen fighters in the war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript:;">Led the Hezb-e-Islami, which clashed with other mujahideen factions in the struggle for control of Kabul in the bloody civil war of the 1990s</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript:;">igned a peace deal with the Afghan government in September 2016</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>His move to renounce the Taliban insurgency, calling it irreligious, plays to the interests of the Afghan government.</p>
    <p>The Taliban, al-Qaeda and IS recruit young fighters on the basis that they are fighting to defend their religion and culture from foreigners.</p>
    <p>But in his first public speech last week, Mr Hekmatyar told the Taliban that they were the reason for foreign forces' presence in Afghanistan. If they stopped fighting and there was peace, there would be no reason for the foreign forces to stay.</p>
