    <p>The duke carried out 110 days of engagements in 2016, making him the fifth busiest member of the royal family, according to Court Circular listings.</p>
    <p>He is patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations and will continue to be associated with them, but "will no longer play an active role by attending engagements", Buckingham Palace said.</p>
    <p>In the statement, the spokesman said the duke "may still choose to attend certain public events from time to time".</p>
